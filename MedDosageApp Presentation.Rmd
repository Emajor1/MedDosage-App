# Slide 1: MedDosage App

**Welcome to the Medication Dosage Calculator**  
**Created on `r Sys.Date()`**

---

# Slide 2: What the App Does

**- Accepts weight in pounds**

**- Adjusts for age, gender, frequency, and concentration**

**- Calculates total daily dose, dose per administration, and volume per dose**

**- Displays results and a visual bar chart**

---

# Slide 3: Why It Matters

**- Clinically relevant and beginner-friendly**

**- Helps users understand weight-based dosing**

**- Can be expanded for pediatric logic or max dose limits**

**- Useful for students, clinicians, and caregivers**

# Slide 4: Embedded R Code

```{r}
# Sample dosage calculation
weight_lbs <- 154
weight_kg <- weight_lbs * 0.453592
dose_mg <- weight_kg * 15  # Paracetamol
dose_mg


## Sample Dosage vs. Weight Plot
weight_lbs <- seq(50, 250, by = 10)
weight_kg <- weight_lbs * 0.453592
dose_mg <- weight_kg * 15  # Paracetamol

plot(weight_lbs, dose_mg, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Weight (lbs)", ylab = "Dosage (mg)",
     main = "Paracetamol Dosage by Weight")



## Interactive Dosage Plot
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = weight_lbs, y = dose_mg, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',
        line = list(color = 'green')) %>%
  layout(title = "Interactive Dosage Curve",
         xaxis = list(title = "Weight (lbs)"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Dosage (mg)"))
